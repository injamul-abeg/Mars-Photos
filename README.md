# Mars-Photos
 MarsPhotos is a demo app that shows actual images of Mar's surface. These images are real-life photos from Mars captured by NASA's Mars rovers. The data is stored on a Web server as a REST web service. This app demonstrated the use of Retrofit to make REST requests to the web service, Moshi to handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and Coil to load images by URL.
